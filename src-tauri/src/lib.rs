//! Rebuffer — persistent clipboard history for Windows.
//!
//! Three long-lived pieces share one process: the message-loop thread that owns
//! the hidden clipboard-listener window, the store, and the pre-created popup
//! WebView2 window. The settings and tray-menu windows are built on demand and
//! destroyed again when idle. See `docs/SPEC.md` §1.
//!
//! OWNER: the coordinator. Workers add to their own modules, not here.
